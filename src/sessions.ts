/**
 * Continuing a session this conversation did not start.
 *
 * A conversation's session id is DERIVED — chat, workspace, epoch — and that is
 * what makes a restarted process find the same conversation again. The one
 * thing derivation cannot express is "carry on with that other session": the
 * one left behind by `/new`, or the one opened on a laptop in the web UI and
 * now wanted on a phone.
 *
 * So a pick is an override on the derivation, and the whole design here follows
 * from what a chat can safely be shown and safely be given:
 *
 * - **Nothing is typed.** A session id is a machine identifier; asking someone
 *   to transcribe `lark-oc_…--e3` on a phone is not an interface. Every switch
 *   is a press on a row this channel produced, which is also what makes the
 *   list the only place authorization has to happen.
 * - **The list is the boundary.** A conversation may continue its own past
 *   sessions and sessions no conversation owns; never another chat's, whose
 *   title alone is a summary of what was said there.
 * - **The workspace decides what is on offer.** A session carries the directory
 *   it runs in, so continuing one from elsewhere would move the sandbox without
 *   anyone saying so. To reach those, `/cd` there first.
 * - **A pick is undone by picking.** This conversation's own derived session is
 *   always a row, so going back is the same gesture as going away — no second
 *   verb, nothing to remember.
